# Configuration and page elements

There are a number of ways to configure `sphinx-book-theme`. This page covers some of the main ways
to do so. It also serves as a reference to make sure that visual elements look correct

## Sidebars

There are two different kinds of sidebar-like content in `sphinx-book-theme`,
typical `{sidebar}` directives, as well as a theme-specific `{margin}` directive.
This section covers both. Both allow you to place extra content
separately from your main content.

```{tip}
Sidebar content will generally overlap with the white space where your site's
table of contents lives. When the reader scrolls sidebar content into view, the
right TOC should hide itself automatically.
