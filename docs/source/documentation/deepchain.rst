Proteins...
===========

- are the driving force of life, they catalyze reactions, transport and react to signals, build tissues, maintain balance in organism, detect and protect us from infections
- are long, linear sequences of 20 different amino acids and their function relies on the 3D structure they acquire once they are formed
- structure can be modified by mutations to the amino acid sequence, and thus, modifying this sequence
-  can acquire new or improved functions that can be used to find new medicines and vaccines

What is DeepChain™ ?
--------------------

DeepChain™ optimises the design of new protein molecules to attain novel activity, behavior, or purpose, and to advance basic understanding of protein function. DeepChain™ at the crossroads of AI and Biology.

DeepChain™ MODULES & FEATURES
-----------------------------

- **Playground**: Leverage AI models trained using UniRef100 with data on 2.1B proteins to uncover novel protein sequences and discover new protein properties

- **AI Designer**: Optimize your protein candidate sequence to its highest binding affinity towards a target, maximizing its specificity and reducing off-target effects

- **Molecular Dynamics**: Explore the behaviour of your existing protein complexes or the newly generated sequences using AI designer through powerful in-silico molecular dynamics simulation

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Conduct personalised analyses of all your structures in hosted jupyter notebooks, with the help of any Python or R library

.. tip:: Create a free account on `deepchain <https://deepchain.bio>`_ in 2 minutes to discover protein design features.

DeepChain apps for protein design
---------------------------------

In general, protein design is a multi-objective optimisation challenge.

Deepchain apps allows you to build your own custom score that you can optimize during the process.

If you want to know more about how to create, build and deploy, have a look at the `quickstart <https://deepchain-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quick_start.html>`_
and the `apps basic <https://deepchain-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/apps_building.html>`_ section.


How to use my app in DeepChain™?
--------------------------------

In the **AI Designer**, when launching an experiment, you can select multiple apps and scores to guide the optimization process.

Deepchain hub
-------------

The hub allows having a look at the work of other researchers in biology. This is the place where you can find public apps.

Deepchain personnal account
---------------------------

To deploy your application on deepchain with the `cli`, you need to generate a personal access token in the settings part.
